<tr><td colspan="3">In its Open Data White Paper "Unleashing the Potential" the Government outlined its serious intent to make public sector data more available to businesses and to the public. Deloitte will help departments to deliver this by capturing a clear understanding of their data's current availability and the actions needed to increase that availability. This may be used to assist portfolio planning or support business case development. The White Paper stated a principle that organisations should “Release data quickly, and then work to make sure that it is available in open standard formats, including linked-data forms.” The industry standard for measuring data availability is the 'Five Stars of Linked Open Data', specified by Sir Tim Berbers-Lee. The pinnacle of availability is considered to be a 5 star 'linked data' rating which indicates that the data is both available and is already linked to other data sources; allowing it to be easily exploited to generate insight. It may not be practical or good value for money to attempt to make all of an organisation's data meet this standard. To make meaningful progress, each department will need to understand where their gaps are, the ones to focus on that will drive the greatest value and the practical steps they can take to resolve these gaps. Deloitte will guide the client through this process, using a standardised approach, drawing on our extensive experience of data quality, data management and data transformation. We will also bring industry leading experts to this process from our excellent contacts in academia.</td></tr>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          <tr><td>Deloitte LLP</td><td>4.G4.0642.304</td><td><a href='http://govstore.service.gov.uk/cloudstore/d-g4-l4-238-open-data-transformation4-g4-0642-304'>D-G4-L4-238 Open Data Transformation</a></td></tr>

Whether it is the client's intention to transform to this level of maturity, or simply to make the data available on the web in its current form, Deloitte can scope, design and deliver the change needed.</td></tr>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <tr><td>Open Data Institute</td><td>4.G4.0566.201</td><td><a href='http://govstore.service.gov.uk/cloudstore/consultancy-services-open-data-transparency4-g4-0566-201'>Consultancy Services - Open Data/Transparency</a></td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="3">CKAN is a powerful data management system to publish open government data. It is used by various national governments and public institutions around the world, like data.gov.uk, data.gov, and the EU open data portal (see also www.ckan.org/instances). WHY CKAN? Some core characteristics make it a perfect choice for any public sector institution: CKAN.org is a community-based open source project and the source code is AGPL v3 licensed. This open approach assures users maximum room for manoeuvre in the future, protects their investment and prevents vendor lock-in. CKAN’s architecture is highly modular: components and extensions allow the system to be customized to your needs. Developers can easily extend its functionality without the need to understand the whole system. In addition, CKAN offers a rich RESTful API (using JSON representations) that exposes all of CKAN’s core functionality to external client applications using only open web standards. Finally, CKAN adheres to open standards ensuring interoperability like INSPIRE, OGC CSW, metadata based on DCAT, as well as HTML and web services based on REST. FEATURES. CKAN supports publishers and data re-users alike. Publishers benefit from easy metadata management, workflow and approval support, user authorization, the reporting of broken links, and analytics and use stats. Re-users benefit from a long list of search and discovery features, like powerful search/filtering incl. “following” datasets, faceted browsing by tags/publishers/keywords/etc., a data explorer that allows preview, inspection and basic graphing for many types of data. In addition, CKAN offers INSPIRE-compliant geospatial capabilities like geo-search, map visualization, and metadata schemas (ISO19139, Gemini2.1, CSW); harvesting and normalization of metadata from other catalogs/servers from a variety of servers (CKAN, ArcGIS, Geoportal, Z39.50, WAF, CSW); data catalog interoperability (Data Catalog Interoperability Protocol) allowing search across different catalogs; multilingual support. SERVICE. The deployment package is geared towards cities (or federal agencies) who want to set up their own open data portal. It includes Deployment, Testing, Template/Theme Design, and Template/Theme Development of the latest stable release of CKAN 2.x. Usually, portals are deployed on client’s servers, but we can offer alternatives if you prefer a different setup. Maintenance and support as well as bespoke extension, e.g., dashboards or visualisations, are available separately. Please see “CKAN open source open data portal - maintenance/support and technical consulting on demand” on G-Cloud. All core maintainers of CKAN are working for the Open Knowledge Foundation.

## Methodology

This survey was based on data scraped from the [CloudStore](http://govstore.service.gov.uk/cloudstore/). (Unfortunately, the list of G-Cloud services has not been published as open data since the [May 2012 snapshot on data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk/dataset/cloudstore_catalogue_version).) This list was filtered for services mentioning "open data", and filtered again by a reviewer to exclude those services that attempt to increase their appearance in search results simply by listing many keywords.

The full details, and source code, for the survey are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/Digital-Contraptions-Imaginarium/odi-gcloud-analysis).
