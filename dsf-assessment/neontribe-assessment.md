# Neontribe

Neontribe demonstrate an excellent technical approach and understanding of the requirement for engagement around open digital services.

## Understanding data-user needs

*How would you go about understanding the needs of different types of data user to develop a solution that meets the needs of specialist and non-specialist users alike?*

**A Basic response.**

Neontribe demonstrated a very good approach to the process of understanding the needs of general users of a website. We were particularly impressed by the clear process that they have for understanding user needs, through to a paper prototype of the site.

However, we were looking for a demonstration of a process for seeking to understand the needs of *data users*, for example an indication that a supplier would ask relevant questions of potential reusers about required data formats, granularity, timeliness and so on.

An Excellent response would have highlighted the possibility of engaging data users in reusing the data itself early in the process, and iteratively throughout the process, to ensure that the data was provided to them in a way that met their needs. (Neontribe did mention this in the section on Technical issues.)

## Data processing

*How would you take messy data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats and import it into a backend system that can drive a website?*

**A Good response.**

Neontribe demonstrated a good understanding of the challenges in handling messy or incomplete data, and particularly the need for human involvement in the process of cleaning and decision making.

An Excellent response would have highlighted the need to record the processing of data that was carried out, to provide a provenance trail for reusers of the data to better understand (and replicate) that processing.

## Data exploration

*How would you create a useful and meaningful interface and/or visualisations so users can pose and answer simple questions from the data?*

**A Basic response.**

Neontribe provided a good set of examples of their previous work that demonstrates their skills with a range of visualisation techniques.

However, we were looking for a demonstration of understanding that a website for data users would need to provide customised visualisations, searches, *and download facilities for the data itself*.

An Excellent response would have also highlighted the need to provide, within the main website, targeted APIs and/or guidance that enable data users to reuse the data that is otherwise provided in a human-readable way within the pages.

## Legal issues

*What activities would you undertake to tackle the legal issues around data publishing, including licensing, intellectual property rights, derived data and privacy?*

**A Good response.**

Neontribe demonstrated an understanding of what open licensing entails, and that there are complexities around licensing and other legal requirements when publishing data, though we're not sure how FOI requirements would relate to protecting people's privacy.

An Excellent response would have talked about providing more legal information for data users, including for example any required attribution or citation statements, and providing that information in machine-readable form.

## Practical issues

*How would you ensure that the data is easy to find, and that any issues about its quality are documented?*

**A Good response.**

Neontribe described methods for ensuring that the data was findable, such as registering it on data.gov.uk, and mentioned providing information about the quality of the dataset, though only in a cursory way.

An Excellent response would have also described providing methods for data users to feed back any quality issues that they encountered within the data, to enable its incremental improvement.

## Technical issues

*How would you publish different types of data (reference data, raw data, aggregate statistical data) as open data in ways that meets a variety of different data users needs? What formats and open standards would you use? How would you approach creating persistent identifiers? What additional metadata, such as provenance metadata, would you provide?*

**An Excellent response.**

Neontribe described selecting applicable open standards (including JSON, XML and CSV) for publishing the data and metadata, and the use of identifiers for things described in the data.

## Social issues

*How would you support users of open data with relevant documentation, source code snippets, example queries and technical advice? How would you provide feedback routes to the publisher?*

**An Excellent response.**

Neontribe discussed how they would provide documentation, source code, example queries and technical advice via a wiki. They went further to outline providing information back to the publisher about how the data was used, and showed awareness of the options and understanding of why that feedback is important in the long term.

## Team

*What team would you put together to provide this service?*

**An Excellent response.**

Neontribe's team shows a good mix of skills for delivering an open digital service, in user research, front-end and back-end development, and expertise with data.
