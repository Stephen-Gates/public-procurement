# Web Technology Group

The Web Technology Group demonstrated an exemplary understanding of how to deliver an open digital service. They showed an excellent approach to data processing and the publication of data and contextual information relevant to data users. They also discussed the benefits of support and feedback mechanisms between the publisher and data users.

## Understanding data-user needs

*How would you go about understanding the needs of different types of data user to develop a solution that meets the needs of specialist and non-specialist users alike?*

**A Good response.**

The Web Technology Group demonstrate a very good approach to understanding user needs, including those of data users, such as required data quality, levels of detail or granularity, and the need to look at the tools that data users will use to process the available data.

An Excellent response would have highlighted the possibility of engaging data users in reusing the data itself early in the process, and iteratively throughout the process, to ensure that the data was provided to them in a way that met their needs.

## Data processing

*How would you take messy data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats and import it into a backend system that can drive a website?*

**An Excellent response.**

The Web Technology Group gave an outstanding response, which touched on the challenges in handling messy or incomplete data, but crucially also highlighted the need to record the processing and transformation of data to provide a provenance trail for reusers of the data to better understand (and replicate) that processing, and to preserve its integrity.

## Data exploration

*How would you create a useful and meaningful interface and/or visualisations so users can pose and answer simple questions from the data?*

**A Good response.**

The Web Technology Group gave a brief outline of the type of interface they would build, touching on important features such as supporting customised searches and visualisations of data, and supporting data reusers by providing downloads for further processing.

An Excellent response would have also highlighted the need to provide, within the main website, targeted APIs and/or guidance that enable data users to reuse the data that is otherwise provided in a human-readable way within the pages.

## Legal issues

*What activities would you undertake to tackle the legal issues around data publishing, including licensing, intellectual property rights, derived data and privacy?*

**A Good response.**

The Web Technology Group show a good understanding of the legal issues that need to be covered when providing an open digital service, particularly those around rights and licensing.

An Excellent response would have talked about providing more legal information for data users, including for example any required attribution or citation statements, and providing that information in machine-readable form.

## Practical issues

*How would you ensure that the data is easy to find, and that any issues about its quality are documented?*

**An Excellent response.**

The Web Technology Group provided an exemplary response. It highlighted several methods to ensure that the data was visible on the web, including registration on data.gov.uk. They outlined the requirement to provide quality information for reusers, and importantly recognised that feedback from reusers would help to address data quality issues.

## Technical issues

*How would you publish different types of data (reference data, raw data, aggregate statistical data) as open data in ways that meets a variety of different data users needs? What formats and open standards would you use? How would you approach creating persistent identifiers? What additional metadata, such as provenance metadata, would you provide?*

**An Excellent response.**

The Web Technology Group gave a superb, detailed response that highlighted the different standard data formats that would be appropriate for each type of data published. They described the use of persistent identifiers, and pointed at the relevant government standard that recommends using URLs for those identifiers. They listed in detail the types of metadata that they would publish and the formats that they would publish them in.

## Social issues

*How would you support users of open data with relevant documentation, source code snippets, example queries and technical advice? How would you provide feedback routes to the publisher?*

**An Excellent response.**

The Web Technology Group demonstrated an exemplary understanding of the support needed for data users, including user and technical guides and the provision of documentation about vocabularies and taxonomies. They also gave concrete potential routes for creating self-supporting communities around open data, and of having an engaging and reinforcing dialog between reusers and publishers.

## Team

*What team would you put together to provide this service?*

**A Good response.**

The Web Technology Group's team composition covered most of the roles required to deliver an open digital service. An Excellent response would have explicitly mentioned a UI/UX Developer to ensure that the service provided an engaging interface.
