# Changeful

*Changeful's response only explicitly addressed the "Understanding data-user needs" part of the assessment. While the response touched on a number of the other areas of the assessment, we have not assessed Changeful against the other headings.*

Changeful's approach is a superlative example of how to bring the data user's needs into the heart of an open digital service. They also demonstrate a deep understanding of the important aspects of open data publication. While they cannot deliver an open digital service alone, they would be an invaluable asset to any team developing such a service.

## Understanding data-user needs

*How would you go about understanding the needs of different types of data user to develop a solution that meets the needs of specialist and non-specialist users alike?*

**A Good response.**

Changeful demonsrate an exemplary approach to embedding the voice of the user, including data users, throughout the project. We were particularly impressed by the proposals to:

  * collaboratively draft an Open Data Certificate to which the project team aspires, early in the project
  * map the service ecosystem, including stakeholders outside the immediate circle of the project
  * making a first release of the data early in the process, to gain feedback on how the data will actually be used by reusers

## Data processing

*How would you take messy data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats and import it into a backend system that can drive a website?*

**No response.**

## Data exploration

*How would you create a useful and meaningful interface and/or visualisations so users can pose and answer simple questions from the data?*

**No response.**

## Legal issues

*What activities would you undertake to tackle the legal issues around data publishing, including licensing, intellectual property rights, derived data and privacy?*

**No response.**

## Practical issues

*How would you ensure that the data is easy to find, and that any issues about its quality are documented?*

**No response.**

## Technical issues

*How would you publish different types of data (reference data, raw data, aggregate statistical data) as open data in ways that meets a variety of different data users needs? What formats and open standards would you use? How would you approach creating persistent identifiers? What additional metadata, such as provenance metadata, would you provide?*

**No response.**

## Social issues

*How would you support users of open data with relevant documentation, source code snippets, example queries and technical advice? How would you provide feedback routes to the publisher?*

**No response.**

## Team

*What team would you put together to provide this service?*

**No response.**
