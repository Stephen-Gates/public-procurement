# ScraperWiki

ScraperWiki provides an exemplary capability for delivering an open digital service. They demonstrated an excellent approach to data processing and the publication of data and contextual information relevant to data users. The ScraperWiki platform provides a powerful and flexible range of capabilities for processing, delivering and exploring open data.

## Understanding data-user needs

*How would you go about understanding the needs of different types of data user to develop a solution that meets the needs of specialist and non-specialist users alike?*

**A Good response.**

ScraperWiki demonstrated a good approach to understanding user's needs, including those of data users. ScraperWiki uses an agile method and rapid development techniques to iteratively develop services that meet users needs. In response to the Technical Issues question, ScraperWiki also recognises the specific needs of data users, as being distinct from those of data publishers, and explained how they would understand those needs, for example around data standards and formats. 

An Excellent response would have highlighted the possibility of engaging data users in reusing the data itself early in the process, and iteratively throughout the process, to ensure that the data was provided to them in a way that met their needs.

## Data processing

*How would you take messy data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats and import it into a backend system that can drive a website?*

**An Excellent response.**

ScraperWiki provides an outstanding capability for handling the challenges of messy or incomplete data. ScraperWiki gave several excellent examples of projects they have undertaken involving significant data processing activities. In addition, in answer to the Technical Issues question, ScraperWiki make the point that all data is useless unless you know how it is corrected. They would publish links to the original source of the data, the methodology, and source code that processed the data. This is an exemplary approach to processing government open data.

## Data exploration

*How would you create a useful and meaningful interface and/or visualisations so users can pose and answer simple questions from the data?*

**An Excellent response.**

ScraperWiki's platform provides an impressive range of data visualisation tools, for both general users and also for data users, including the ability to summarise data, plot a graph or view on a map. There is also an excellent capability to use ScraperWiki as a bridge to several different data analysis tools, such as Tableau and QlikView. We were particularly interested to see the support ScraperWiki provides for connecting with OData. ScraperWiki also provided some outstanding examples, such as the Health Research Map for Liverpool John Moore University.

## Legal issues

*What activities would you undertake to tackle the legal issues around data publishing, including licensing, intellectual property rights, derived data and privacy?*

**A Good response.**

ScraperWiki demonstrated a good understanding of the legal issues involved in providing an open digital service.

An Excellent response would have talked about providing more legal information for data users, including for example any required attribution or citation statements, and providing that information in machine-readable form.

## Practical issues

*How would you ensure that the data is easy to find, and that any issues about its quality are documented?*

**A Basic response.**

ScraperWiki describe methods for ensuring that the data is findable through web based search-engine optimisation as well as registering data with a data catalogue. In our scenario we would have liked to have seen specific reference to registering the data with data.gov.uk.

An Excellent response would have also described providing methods for data users to feed back any quality issues that they encountered within the data, to enable its incremental improvement.

## Technical issues

*How would you publish different types of data (reference data, raw data, aggregate statistical data) as open data in ways that meets a variety of different data users needs? What formats and open standards would you use? How would you approach creating persistent identifiers? What additional metadata, such as provenance metadata, would you provide?*

**An Excellent response.**

ScraperWiki have a superb technical capability for delivering an open digital service. They described how they would meet data user's needs, for example by providing the content in simple machine readable formats, like CSV or for more sophisticated data, in JSON, as well understanding how best to leverage the agency's existing standards, including any internal data models. They have a thought through position regarding the use of persistent identifiers and also a very good approach to provenance. ScraperWiki's response clealy evidences the depth of experience and understanding they bring to an open data project.

## Social issues

*How would you support users of open data with relevant documentation, source code snippets, example queries and technical advice? How would you provide feedback routes to the publisher?*

**A Basic response.**

ScraperWiki has an excellent track record of working closely with the open data community and has developed a wide range of relationships. The 'Open Your Data' tool is a great initiative for data geeks to publish data through ScraperWiki.

An Excellent response would have said more about supporting users of the data, with documentation, source code, example queries and technical advice. It would also cover how users of the data might feedback to the publisher how the data was being used, as well as ways of making improvements to the data. 

## Team

*What team would you put together to provide this service?*

**An Excellent response.**

ScraperWiki provides an exemplary capability for delivering an open digital service, with a very experienced team. They can engage flexibly with different types and scales of project, either as the lead, or in a supporting role. The examples given demonstrate the range of depth of ScraperWiki's experience. The proposed approach given is well matched to the needs of an open digital service.
