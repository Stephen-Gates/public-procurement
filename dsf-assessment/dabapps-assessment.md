# DabApps

DabApps demonstrated an excellent understanding of how to process and present data through a website, including in appropriate data formats. They also had some brilliant ideas about how to use existing social media tools to support data reusers.

## Understanding data-user needs

*How would you go about understanding the needs of different types of data user to develop a solution that meets the needs of specialist and non-specialist users alike?*

**A Basic response.**

DabApps demonstrated a good approach to the process of understanding the needs of general users of a website, including the creation of personas.

However, we were looking for a demonstration of a process for seeking to understand the needs of *data users*, for example an indication that a supplier would ask relevant questions of potential reusers about required data formats, granularity, timeliness and so on.

An Excellent response would have highlighted the possibility of engaging data users in reusing the data itself early in the process, and iteratively throughout the process, to ensure that the data was provided to them in a way that met their needs.

## Data processing

*How would you take messy data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats and import it into a backend system that can drive a website?*

**An Excellent response.**

DabApps demonstrated an excellent approach to data processing, recognising the different processing requirements of different sources of data, and the need to balance automated processing with user input. They also highlighted the importance of documenting the transformation workflow so that it could be understood and replicated.

## Data exploration

*How would you create a useful and meaningful interface and/or visualisations so users can pose and answer simple questions from the data?*

**An Excellent response.**

DabApps gave an exemplary response which highlighted access through a web interface both to a presentational view, including searches and visualisations, and the underlying datasets. They highlighted the integration between searches over data and both a JSON API and CSV downloads for the data. They also emphasised the availability of source data, source code and documentation, all of which help reusers to understand and build on the available data.

## Legal issues

*What activities would you undertake to tackle the legal issues around data publishing, including licensing, intellectual property rights, derived data and privacy?*

**A Basic response.**

DabApps's response touched on some of the relevant legislation when publishing data, and correctly identified some possible open licences that could be used.

We were looking for a deeper understanding of the wider context of legal issues and requirements that come into play when publishing data.

An Excellent response would have talked about providing more legal information for data users, including for example any required attribution or citation statements, and providing that information in machine-readable form.

## Practical issues

*How would you ensure that the data is easy to find, and that any issues about its quality are documented?*

**A Good response.**

DabApps discussed findability of data extensively, including highlighting the need to provide context information on landing pages to make it easy to understand. They also discussed finding data through search engines and registering it on data.gov.uk.

An Excellent response would have also described providing methods for data users to feed back any quality issues that they encountered within the data, to enable its incremental improvement.

## Technical issues

*How would you publish different types of data (reference data, raw data, aggregate statistical data) as open data in ways that meets a variety of different data users needs? What formats and open standards would you use? How would you approach creating persistent identifiers? What additional metadata, such as provenance metadata, would you provide?*

**An Excellent response.**

DabApps showed a good understanding of the applicability of different data formats, such as JSON, CSV and XML, for the publication of data, and discussed both using APIs and providing bulk downloads. They discussed using unique identifiers within the data, and researching formats that are already standard in the area.

## Social issues

*How would you support users of open data with relevant documentation, source code snippets, example queries and technical advice? How would you provide feedback routes to the publisher?*

**An Excellent response.**

DabApps demonstrated an excellent approach to supporting reusers of data, including providing source code, documentation and code snippets. They also outlined how they would use existing platforms, such as GitHub, Twitter, and Google Groups, appropriately to support users.

## Team

*What team would you put together to provide this service?*

**An Excellent response.**

DabApps' team shows a good mix of skills for delivering an open digital service, in user research, front-end and back-end development, and expertise with data.
