# Mando Group

Mando demonstrate an excellent approach to delivering an open digital service. Their response tackles the delivery of an engaging and useful interface onto data that also provides for data user needs. They show an understanding of the information that data reusers need around the legal constraints on reuse, contextual information about the data, and support for reuse.

## Understanding data-user needs

*How would you go about understanding the needs of different types of data user to develop a solution that meets the needs of specialist and non-specialist users alike?*

**A Basic response.**

Mando demonstrated a good approach to the process of understanding the needs of general users of a website, including creating personas and identifying and prioritising key tasks for those users.

However, we were looking for a demonstration of a process for seeking to understand the needs of *data users*, for example an indication that a supplier would ask relevant questions of potential reusers about required data formats, granularity, timeliness and so on.

An Excellent response would have highlighted the possibility of engaging data users in reusing the data itself early in the process, and iteratively throughout the process, to ensure that the data was provided to them in a way that met their needs.

## Data processing

*How would you take messy data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats and import it into a backend system that can drive a website?*

**A Good response.**

Mando demonstrated a very good understanding of the challenges in handling messy or incomplete data, particularly highlighting the importance of using data dictionaries to improve consistency in the data.

An Excellent response would have highlighted the need to record the processing of data that was carried out, to provide a provenance trail for reusers of the data to better understand (and replicate) that processing.

## Data exploration

*How would you create a useful and meaningful interface and/or visualisations so users can pose and answer simple questions from the data?*

**An Excellent response.**

Mando described an interface for data exploration that combined pre-designed visualisations with the ability to automatically create charts while exploring the data. They discussed the need for flexible interrogation of the data through the interface. They also highlighted the needs of data users, both to download relevant parts of the data and in the availability of guidance targeted at them.

## Legal issues

*What activities would you undertake to tackle the legal issues around data publishing, including licensing, intellectual property rights, derived data and privacy?*

**An Excellent response.**

Mando demonstrated a superb understanding of the range of legal issues that need to be covered when providing an open digital service, including rights, licensing, privacy, liability and warranties. They also highlighted making it easy for users to understand those terms, and for reusers to be provided with easy ways of providing attribution and citation to the data.

## Practical issues

*How would you ensure that the data is easy to find, and that any issues about its quality are documented?*

**An Excellent response.**

Mando described methods for ensuring that the data was findable, such as registering it on data.gov.uk, and providing information about the quality of the dataset and guarantees about its availability. They also mentioned the need to support feedback from reusers to the publishers.

## Technical issues

*How would you publish different types of data (reference data, raw data, aggregate statistical data) as open data in ways that meets a variety of different data users needs? What formats and open standards would you use? How would you approach creating persistent identifiers? What additional metadata, such as provenance metadata, would you provide?*

**An Excellent response.**

Mando provided an excellent outline of the possibilities of different formats for publishing data, and the advantages and appropriateness of each. They highlighted the use of persistent identifiers within the data they published, and the publication of metadata, including its visualisation.

## Social issues

*How would you support users of open data with relevant documentation, source code snippets, example queries and technical advice? How would you provide feedback routes to the publisher?*

**A Good response.**

Mando showed a good understanding of the methods through which documentation and other support could be provided to users, and some of the technical options for making that possible. We liked the idea of tracking how the data and visualisations were being shared on social media channels.

An Excellent response would have discussed the importance of creating self-supporting communities around open data, and of having an engaging and reinforcing dialog between reusers and publishers.

## Team

*What team would you put together to provide this service?*

**A Good response.**

Mando's team composition covered most of the roles required to deliver an open digital service. An Excellent response would have mentioned the availability of a User Researcher to ensure consideration of user needs were embedded throughout the project.
