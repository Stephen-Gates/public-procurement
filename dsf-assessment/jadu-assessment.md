# Jadu

Jadu have demonstrated an excellent technical capability to deliver an open data project, backed up by a good all round team.

## Understanding data-user needs

*How would you go about understanding the needs of different types of data user to develop a solution that meets the needs of specialist and non-specialist users alike?*

**A Basic response.**

Jadu demonstrated a good approach to understanding the needs of general users including interviews and work shadowing. They also have a good understanding of agile development, with user stories delivered over short sprints of development.

We were looking for suppliers to propose a process to understand the needs of *data users* in particular, for example an indication that a supplier would ask relevant questions of potential reusers about required data formats, granularity, timeliness and so on.

An Excellent response would have highlighted the possibility of engaging data users in reusing the data itself early in the project, and iteratively throughout the process of development, to ensure that the data was provided to them in a way that met their needs.

## Data processing

*How would you take messy data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats and import it into a backend system that can drive a website?*

**A Good response.**

Jadu demonstrated a good understanding of the challenges in handling messy or incomplete data. The approached outlined, of cleaning and converting the data to open standard formats was particularly well judged.

An Excellent response would have highlighted the need to record the processing of data that was carried out, to provide a provenance trail for reusers of the data to better understand (and, if needbe, replicate) that processing.

## Data exploration

*How would you create a useful and meaningful interface and/or visualisations so users can pose and answer simple questions from the data?*

**A Basic response.**

Jadu explained the facility in the Content Management System of a directory browser interface that can be used to visualise data. We tried out accessing the data on some of the example local authority websites built using the CMS. A notable feature of the proposal was the RESTful API, that in conjunction with an API Key, could be used to access the data in a machine readable form.

We would have liked to have seen an approach to visualising the data that allows users to access the data as a whole dataset, in addition to working through a tree to locate particular records. It would also be good if users could use the visualisations to search and query the data.

An Excellent response would have described customised visualisations, searches, *and download facilities for the data itself*. One of the benefits of visualisations is that, as well as supporting general users, they can help to document the data for re-users, helping them to more easily understand the data.

## Legal issues

*What activities would you undertake to tackle the legal issues around data publishing, including licensing, intellectual property rights, derived data and privacy?*

**An Excellent response.**

Jadu's response covered all the important legal issues in an open data project, including the documents that need to be published so users of the data are clear where they stand, managing licensing issues, anonymisation of any personal data and disclosure controls. We were pleased to see the proposal for links to the copyright notice in the page templates, as well as the machine readable rights statement. We would have liked to have seen reference made to the Open Government Licence, but Jadu's response did make the use of an open licence very clear.

## Practical issues

*How would you ensure that the data is easy to find, and that any issues about its quality are documented?*

**An Excellent response.**

Jadu demonstrated an excellent understanding of the practical issues of providing open data. They would advise the data holder to register the data with a catalogue such as data.gov.uk, as well as making it easy to discover the data through the website. We were pleased to see proposals about making data available to web crawlers, by using more semantic HTML. We were also pleased to see an understanding about documenting the data as well as giving data users a route to feedback any problems or issues they encounter, or to offer corrections to errors in the data.

## Technical issues

*How would you publish different types of data (reference data, raw data, aggregate statistical data) as open data in ways that meets a variety of different data users needs? What formats and open standards would you use? How would you approach creating persistent identifiers? What additional metadata, such as provenance metadata, would you provide?*

**An Excellent response.**

Jadu showed an excellent understanding of the applicability of different data formats, such as JSON, CSV and XML, for the publication of data, and discussed both using APIs and providing bulk downloads. They discussed using unique identifiers within the data and the use of appropriate metadata standards.

## Social issues

*How would you support users of open data with relevant documentation, source code snippets, example queries and technical advice? How would you provide feedback routes to the publisher?*

**A Good response.**

Jadu propose an exciting variety of ways to engage with users of the data. As well as providing documentation, source code on popular code repositories and technical advice, Jadu would also engage developers through hack-days, as well as online through blogs and forums.

An Excellent response would cover how users of the data could feedback to the publisher about how the data was being used, as well as ways of making improvements to the data. Jadu would offer a web form to do this, but we would have liked to have seen proposals for how users can directly contribute improvements to the data.

## Team

*What team would you put together to provide this service?*

**An Excellent response.**

Jadu are able to provide a team with a good mix of skills for delivering an open digital service, with business analysts, user experience, front-end and back-end development, and expertise with handling data.
