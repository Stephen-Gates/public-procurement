# CDS

CDS have an excellent capability, with a good grasp of the issues when working with data.

## Understanding data-user needs

*How would you go about understanding the needs of different types of data user to develop a solution that meets the needs of specialist and non-specialist users alike?*

**A Basic response.**

CDS demonstrated a very good approach to the process of understanding the needs of general users. The proposals to hold stakeholder interviews and run user experience workshops, to better understand the information needs of service users, were good.

However, we were looking for a demonstration of a process for seeking to understand the needs of *data users*, for example an indication that a supplier would ask relevant questions of potential reusers about required data formats, granularity, timeliness and so on.

An Excellent response would have highlighted the possibility of engaging data users in reusing the data itself early in the process, and iteratively throughout the process, to ensure that the data was provided to them in a way that met their needs.

## Data processing

*How would you take messy data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats and import it into a backend system that can drive a website?*

**A Good response.**

CDS demonstrated a very good understanding of the challenges in handling messy or incomplete data. The approach outlined, using ETL transforms to first clean and then organise the data in a data warehouse, prior to moving on to publication, was good.

An Excellent response would have highlighted the need to record the processing of data that was carried out, to provide a provenance trail for reusers of the data to better understand (and replicate) that processing.

## Data exploration

*How would you create a useful and meaningful interface and/or visualisations so users can pose and answer simple questions from the data?*

**A Basic response.**

CDS provided a good set of examples of their previous work that demonstrates their skills with a range of visualisation techniques. The approach hinges on creating dashboards that allow users to explore and use the data. CDS have a good track record with developing dashboards.

However, we were looking for more than dashboards. We would have liked the proposal to recognise that a service for data users needs to provide customised visualisations, searches, *and download facilities for the data itself*.

An Excellent response would have also highlighted the need to provide targeted APIs and/or guidance that enable data users to reuse the data that is otherwise provided in a human-readable way within the page.

## Legal issues

*What activities would you undertake to tackle the legal issues around data publishing, including licensing, intellectual property rights, derived data and privacy?*

**A Basic response.**

CDS has an in-house capability to address the various legal issues with publishing open data, such as identifying and managing intellectual property rights, privacy issues and also derived data. The proposal identified all the key issues to be addressed.

CDS recognises the value of standard licensing terms. However a good response would have aligned more closely with the government's strategy for licensing open data, for example by proposing the use of the Open Government Licence.

An Excellent response would have talked about providing more legal information for data users, including for example any required attribution or citation statements, and providing that information in machine-readable form.

## Practical issues

*How would you ensure that the data is easy to find, and that any issues about its quality are documented?*

**A Basic response.**

CDS describe methods for ensuring that the data is findable through web based search-engine optimisation, by following ODI recommendations and also through a search interface for the data. The response would have been improved by specific commitments to registering the datasets on data.gov.uk and any other relevant data catalogues, as well as providing information about the quality of the dataset produced.

An Excellent response would have also described providing methods for data users to feed back any quality issues that they encountered within the data, to enable its incremental improvement.

## Technical issues

*How would you publish different types of data (reference data, raw data, aggregate statistical data) as open data in ways that meets a variety of different data users needs? What formats and open standards would you use? How would you approach creating persistent identifiers? What additional metadata, such as provenance metadata, would you provide?*

**A Poor response.**

CDS outline the role of a business analyst to determine needs and describe at a high level the process they would follow to publish the data. The response would be improved by addressing whether the data would be made available through an API, via a download, or preferrably, both. Also the issues around selection of appropriate data formats and data standards should have been covered.

An Excellent response would have described applicable open standards (including JSON, XML and CSV) for publishing the data and metadata. It would also have proposed the use of persistent web based identifiers for things described in the data.

## Social issues

*How would you support users of open data with relevant documentation, source code snippets, example queries and technical advice? How would you provide feedback routes to the publisher?*

**A Basic response.**

CDS have a good capability to provide technical documentation, with an in-house team of technical authors. There is also a good capability to provide customer support. We were looking for greater emphasis on the needs of data re-users, with documentation, source code, example queries and technical advice all designed with re-users of the data in mind. 

An Excellent response would cover how users of the data could feedback to the publisher about how the data was being used, as well as ways of making improvements to the data. It would outline the use of existing platforms, such as GitHub, Twitter, and Google Groups, to appropriately to support users.

## Team

*What team would you put together to provide this service?*

**An Excellent response.**

CDS are able to provide a team with a good mix of skills for delivering an open digital service, with business analysts, user experience, front-end and back-end development, and expertise with handling data.
