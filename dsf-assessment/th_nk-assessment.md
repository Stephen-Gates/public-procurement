# TH_NK

TH_NK outlined an excellent approach to making data findable and encouraging user feedback on the data.

## Understanding data-user needs

*How would you go about understanding the needs of different types of data user to develop a solution that meets the needs of specialist and non-specialist users alike?*

**A Good response.**

TH_NK demonstrate a approach to the process of understanding the both the needs of general users of a website and specific concerns of data users such as data formats and types of useful analysis.

An Excellent response would have highlighted the possibility of engaging data users in reusing the data itself early in the process, and iteratively throughout the process, to ensure that the data was provided to them in a way that met their needs.

## Data processing

*How would you take messy data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats and import it into a backend system that can drive a website?*

**A Poor response.**

TH_NK demonstrate very little practical understanding of issues around processing data.

We were looking for a concrete approach to tackling transforming data into a useful format, and an understanding of some of the challenges of handling messy or incomplete data and how these might be tackled.

An Excellent response would have highlighted the need to record the processing of data that was carried out, to provide a provenance trail for reusers of the data to better understand (and replicate) that processing.

## Data exploration

*How would you create a useful and meaningful interface and/or visualisations so users can pose and answer simple questions from the data?*

**A Basic response.**

TH_NK discuss some of the methods by which users might interact with data, including the provision of interactive visualisations that support exploring the data.

However, we were looking for a demonstration of understanding that a website for data users would need to provide customised visualisations, searches, *and download facilities for the data itself*.

An Excellent response would have also highlighted the need to provide, within the main website, targeted APIs and/or guidance that enable data users to reuse the data that is otherwise provided in a human-readable way within the pages.

## Legal issues

*What activities would you undertake to tackle the legal issues around data publishing, including licensing, intellectual property rights, derived data and privacy?*

**A Poor response.**

TH_NK's response focused on the need to secure and encrypt data to prevent it being used unlawfully. It shows no understanding of open licensing, which is crucial for a project that involves the publication of open data.

We were looking for an understanding of the wider context of legal issues and requirements that come into play when publishing data.

An Excellent response would have talked about providing more legal information for data users, including for example any required attribution or citation statements, and providing that information in machine-readable form.

## Practical issues

*How would you ensure that the data is easy to find, and that any issues about its quality are documented?*

**An Excellent response.**

TH_NK demonstrated an excellent approach to ensuring that data can be found, using the same SEO techniques as apply to any other web content, though they didn't mention explicit registration in portals such as data.gov.uk. They discuss in detail both how to provide contextual information about data quality, and how to engage users in providing feedback on issues with the data.

## Technical issues

*How would you publish different types of data (reference data, raw data, aggregate statistical data) as open data in ways that meets a variety of different data users needs? What formats and open standards would you use? How would you approach creating persistent identifiers? What additional metadata, such as provenance metadata, would you provide?*

**A Basic response.**

TH_NK mention the use of open standards, embedding persistent identifiers to link data sources together, and bring out the fact that some metadata should be published.

However, we were looking for concrete suggestions for applicable data formats, such as JSON, CSV and XML, for the publication of data.

An Excellent response would have talked about investigating which formats are already standard in the area, the use of URLs as identifiers, and specific vocabularies that should be used to publish metadata.

## Social issues

*How would you support users of open data with relevant documentation, source code snippets, example queries and technical advice? How would you provide feedback routes to the publisher?*

**A Good response.**

TH_NK provided some great ideas about the kinds of supporting information that could be provided for different users, such as giving embed codes that enable visualisations to be embedded in other sites, and supporting the sharing of particular views through social media.

An Excellent response would have discussed the importance of creating self-supporting communities around open data, and of having an engaging and reinforcing dialog between reusers and publishers.

## Team

*What team would you put together to provide this service?*

**An Excellent response.**

TH_NK's team shows a good mix of skills for delivering an open digital service, in user research, front-end and back-end development, and expertise with data.
