# PretaGov

PretaGov demonstrated an excellent understanding of the legal and technical considerations that should be taken into account when publishing open data.

## Understanding data-user needs

*How would you go about understanding the needs of different types of data user to develop a solution that meets the needs of specialist and non-specialist users alike?*

**A Good response.**

PretaGov demonstrated a very good approach to understanding users needs. We were particularly impressed by the clear processes that they have in place for doing this. Also, there was a clear recognition of the difference in needs between specialist and non-specialist users.

An Excellent response would have explored in more depth the possibilities of engaging with *data users* in reusing the data itself early in the project, to help ensure that the data was provided to them in a way that met their needs.

## Data processing

*How would you take messy data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats and import it into a backend system that can drive a website?*

**A Good response.**

PretaGov demonstrated an excellent approach to data processing, recognising the different processing requirements of different sources of quite messy data. They identified value in taking samples of data early in the project and also the benefits of prototyping.

An Excellent response would have highlighted the need to record the processing of data that was carried out, to provide a provenance trail for reusers of the data to better understand, and, if need be, replicate, that processing.

## Data exploration

*How would you create a useful and meaningful interface and/or visualisations so users can pose and answer simple questions from the data?*

**A Basic response.**

PretaGov described a really good approach to delivering a high quality user experience for an online service. We were looking for a demonstration of understanding that a website for data users would need to provide customised visualisations, searches, *and download facilities for the data itself*.

An Excellent response would have highlighted the need to provide, within the main website, targeted APIs and/or guidance that enable data users to reuse the data that is otherwise provided in a human-readable way within the page.

## Legal issues

*What activities would you undertake to tackle the legal issues around data publishing, including licensing, intellectual property rights, derived data and privacy?*

**An Excellent response.**

PretaGov's response outlined an exemplary approach to managing legal issues in an open data project. We were particularly pleased to see an understanding of the Open Government Licence and the value of providing licensing information in human readable and machine readable form. Also the issues around both privacy and derived data were covered exceptionally well.

## Practical issues

*How would you ensure that the data is easy to find, and that any issues about its quality are documented?*

**A Basic response.**

PretaGov describe methods for ensuring that the data is findable on the web through its CMS. We would have liked to have seen specific reference to registering the data with a catalogue such as data.gov.uk.

An Excellent response would have also described providing methods for data users to feed back any quality issues that they encountered within the data, to enable its incremental improvement.

## Technical issues

*How would you publish different types of data (reference data, raw data, aggregate statistical data) as open data in ways that meets a variety of different data users needs? What formats and open standards would you use? How would you approach creating persistent identifiers? What additional metadata, such as provenance metadata, would you provide?*

**An Excellent response.**

PretaGov outlined an excellent approach to delivering the technical aspects of an open data project, that covered providing bulk downloads and a RESTful API, addressed the issues around the appropriate formats for the data, providing appropriate metadata, and creating and maintaining persistent identifiers.

## Social issues

*How would you support users of open data with relevant documentation, source code snippets, example queries and technical advice? How would you provide feedback routes to the publisher?*

**A Basic response.**

PretaGov addressed the need to provide appropriate documentation very well. We particularly liked the suggestion of providing both reference documentation for the API and tutorial style worked examples.

An Excellent response would also cover how users of the data might feedback to the publisher how the data was being used, as well as ways of making improvements to the data. 

## Team

*What team would you put together to provide this service?*

**A Basic response.**

PretaGov identify a number of roles for the project. Given the data processing needs of the project we would have expected to see a Database Specialist as part of the team. An Excellent response would show a good mix of skills for delivering an open digital service, in user research, front-end and back-end development, and expertise with data, supported by examples of capability from previous projects.
