# Survey of Suppliers on the Digital Government Framework

We have performed an assessment exercise designed to highlight the capabilities of suppliers on the Digital Government Framework to provide open digital services.

## Methodology

We emailed the 175 registered suppliers on the Digital Government Framework asking them to take part in the assessment and pointing to the [online instructions](http://theodi.org/assessment-of-suppliers-of-open-digital-services) for taking part.

Of the 175 suppliers, only 12 responded. We note that the assessment took place at the end of March and without much time to respond (the initial email was sent 4th March and the deadline was 24th March). This may account for the low response rate: suppliers to government tend to be busy at the end of March as end-of-year contract deadlines approach. **The lack of a response from a given supplier should not be taken as indicative of a lack of capability to fulfil an open digital service contract.**

We scored and evaluated the proposals that we received on each section:

 * **Understanding data-user needs** &mdash; How would you go about understanding the needs of different types of data user to develop a solution that meets the needs of specialist and non-specialist users alike?
  * **Data processing** &mdash; How would you take messy data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats and import it into a backend system that can drive a website?
  * **Data exploration** &mdash; How would you create a useful and meaningful interface and/or visualisations so users can pose and answer simple questions from the data?
  * **Legal issues** &mdash; What activities would you undertake to tackle the legal issues around data publishing, including licensing, intellectual property rights, derived data and privacy?
  * **Practical issues** &mdash; How would you ensure that the data is easy to find, and that any issues about its quality are documented?
  * **Technical issues** &mdash; How would you publish different types of data (reference data, raw data, aggregate statistical data) as open data in ways that meets a variety of different data users needs? What formats and open standards would you use? How would you approach creating persistent identifiers? What additional metadata, such as provenance metadata, would you provide?
  * **Social issues** &mdash; How would you support users of open data with relevant documentation, source code snippets, example queries and technical advice? How would you provide feedback routes to the publisher?
  * **Team** &mdash; What team would you put together to provide this service?

Two of the proposals did not demonstrate a good understanding of open digital services in any of the categories; we have not published them. The others have been published along with their assessments.

## Results

The suppliers who responded to the assessment exercise demonstrated a real enthusiasm for delivering an open digital project. Some were able to demonstrate previous experience in doing so, but in general that experience was thin on the ground and many suppliers hadn't encountered the wider issues in delivering open data. This is indicative of the lightweight way in which much public sector open data is currently published.

The suppliers demonstrated a keen understanding of the kinds of capabilities that would be needed in a team to support an open digital project. They could demonstrate excellent technical capability for delivering such a project. They were also well versed in the principles of the [Government Service Design Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) for delivering an agile project based on user needs.

We note that several of the services provided by suppliers on the Digital Service Framework are also available through G-Cloud.

The Digital Service Framework suppliers who demonstrated, through this exercise, good capabilities in delivering an open digital project, were:

  * [CDS](dsf-assessment/cds-proposal.pdf) have an excellent capability, with a good grasp of the issues when working with data. [Read more...](dsf-assessment/cds-assessment.md)
  
  * [Changeful's](dsf-assessment/changeful-proposal.pdf) approach is a superlative example of how to bring the data user's needs into the heart of an open digital service. They also demonstrate a deep understanding of the important aspects of open data publication. While they cannot deliver an open digital service alone, they would be an invaluable asset to any team developing such a service. [Read more...](dsf-assessment/changeful-assessment.md)
  
  * [DabApps](dsf-assessment/dabapps-proposal.pdf) demonstrated an excellent understanding of how to process and present data through a website, including in appropriate data formats. They also had some brilliant ideas about how to use existing social media tools to support data reusers. [Read more...](dsf-assessment/dabapps-assessment.md)
  
  * [Jadu](dsf-assessment/jadu-proposal.pdf) have demonstrated an excellent technical capability to deliver an open data project, backed up by a good all round team. [Read more...](dsf-assessment/jadu-assessment.md)
  
  * [Mando](dsf-assessment/mando-proposal.pdf) demonstrate an excellent approach to delivering an open digital service. Their response tackles the delivery of an engaging and useful interface onto data that also provides for data user needs. They show an understanding of the information that data reusers need around the legal constraints on reuse, contextual information about the data, and support for reuse.

  * [Neontribe](dsf-assessment/neontribe-proposal.pdf) demonstrate an excellent technical approach and understanding of the requirement for engagement around open digital services. [Read more...](dsf-assessment/neontribe-assessment.md)
  
  * [PretaGov](dsf-assessment/pretagov-proposal.pdf) demonstrated an excellent understanding of the legal and technical considerations that should be taken into account when publishing open data. [Read more...](dsf-assessment/pretagov-assessment.md)
  
  * [ScraperWiki](dsf-assessment/scraperwiki-proposal.pdf) provides an exemplary capability for delivering an open digital service. They demonstrated an excellent approach to data processing and the publication of data and contextual information relevant to data users. The ScraperWiki platform provides a powerful and flexible range of capabilities for processing, delivering and exploring open data. [Read more...](dsf-assessment/scraperwiki-assessment.md)
  
  * [TH_NK](dsf-assessment/th_nk-proposal.pdf) outlined an excellent approach to making data findable and encouraging user feedback on the data. [Read more...](dsf-assessment/th_nk-assessment.md)
  
  * The [Web Technology Group](dsf-assessment/wtg-proposal.pdf) demonstrated an exemplary understanding of how to deliver an open digital service. They showed an excellent approach to data processing and the publication of data and contextual information relevant to data users. They also discussed the benefits of support and feedback mechanisms between the publisher and data users. [Read more...](dsf-assessment/wtg-assessment.md)
